Ecommerce Portfolio Project
Welcome to the Ecommerce Portfolio Project repository! This project is designed to showcase my development journey as I build an ecommerce website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with JWT authentication for user management.

Project Overview
The Ecommerce project is an interactive web application that simulates an online shopping experience. It demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies, user authentication, and database interaction.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

client: This directory contains the frontend code built using React. To start the frontend application, navigate to this directory.
server: This directory contains the backend code built using Node.js and Express.js. It manages database interactions and user authentication.
Getting Started
To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ecommerce-Portfolio-Project.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to both the client and server directories and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the client directory
cd Ecommerce-Portfolio-Project/client
npm install

# Navigate to the server directory
cd ../server
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables: In the server directory, create a .env file to store your environment variables. Configure your MongoDB connection and JWT secret key as follows:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Run the Backend: In the server directory, start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Run the Frontend: In the client directory, start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to explore the frontend of the application.

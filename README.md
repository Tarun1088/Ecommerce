Ecommerce Portfolio Project README
Welcome to the README file for the Ecommerce project built using the MERN stack and JWT authentication. This project is intended to showcase your skills and progress as you develop an ecommerce website. Users can download the project and run it locally to track your development journey. Feel free to refer to this README for instructions and information about the project.

Project Overview
The Ecommerce project is a web application that aims to simulate an online shopping experience. It is developed using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

client: This directory contains the frontend code built using React. Users need to navigate to this directory to start the frontend application.
server: This directory contains the backend code built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles database interactions and user authentication.
